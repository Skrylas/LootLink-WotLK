--==-- LinksList Version History --==--

2.1.6 (Mar 8, 2009):
	Fixed:
		- Updated to a newer version of TradeskillLinksDB3 library, which fixes an error that could occur after
			a Runeforging link was parsed from a chat message and the "Recently Added Links" tooltip was
			shown.
		
		- Updated to a newer version of TalentLinksDB1 library, which fixes an issue wherein Lua patterns
			with a $ anchor token would not return the right results.
		
		- Updated to a newer version of ItemBasicInfoDB3 library, which reduces memory usage and improves
			responsiveness when searching using the Basic Info subsection of the Items section.


2.1.5 (Feb 2, 2009):
	Optimized:
		- Now uses about 55KB less memory at load.
		
		- Using the Tab function of QuickSearch no longer results in lag, which was caused by the changes
			in 2.1.4.
		
		- The Basic Info subsection of the Items section now uses a newer version of the ItemBasicInfoDB
			library which uses fewer resources.


2.1.4 (Jan 16, 2009):
	Optimized:
		- Now uses newer versions of the links databases, which use fewer resources.
		
		- No longer sorts the list of links when first populating it if it's already pre-sorted. This removes
			the noticeable pause when first opening some of the larger sections.


2.1.3 (Dec 30, 2008):
	Fixed:
		- No longer errors when switching to the None section from a section with the scroll bar not
			at the top.


2.1.2 (Dec 19, 2008):
	Fixed:
		- No longer errors when using Tab in QuickSearch.


2.1.1 (Dec 16, 2008):
	Changed:
		- Now uses a newer version of ItemLinksDB3 database which includes more items by default
			and provides support for importing items from the databases of other addons, such as
			LootLink.


2.1.0 (Dec 11, 2008):
	New:
		- Re-added support for additional searching/sorting options for the Items section, including
			information for item type, item subtype, equip location, equip level, and item level.
	
	Changed:
		- Now uses a newer version of the TalentLinksDB1 database which includes more talents
			by default.
		- Now uses a newer version of the AbilityLinksDB2 database which includes a more accurate
			list of linkable abilities and uses less memory.
		- Now uses a newer version of the ItemLinksDB3 database which supports heirloom items.
	
	Fixed:
		- The recently added lists will now show the most recently added links at the top of the list
			rather than the bottom.
		- The ToggleButton will no longer erroneously disregard its saved visibility status and show
			itself on login every time.
	
	Optimized:
		- Now uses a results data format that requires approximately 80% less memory.


2.0.1 (Dec 9, 2008):
	Fixed:
		- A utility function was missing, causing the Section dropdown menu to be unable to open.


2.0.0 (Dec 4, 2008):
	New:
		- Rewritten for simplicity and efficiency.


1.3.2 (May 31, 2008):
	- Selecting "None" for the section will now properly maintain that selection on subsequent openings
		of the frame, instead of opening the last remembered section for the previous session.


1.3.1 (May 20, 2008):
	- Updated embedded libraries.


1.3.0 (Apr 18, 2008):
	- Added "panel" slash subcommand to toggle whether the results frame acts like a Blizzard UI
		panel (moves as other panels open and close).
	
	- Fixed a bug where the saved configuration settings table was not having its "version" property
		set properly, causing the "togglebutton" property to keep resetting to enabled.


1.2.0 (Apr 15, 2008):
	- Rewrote sorting implementation to use a custom version of the MergeSort algorithm instead of
		Lua's unstable QuickSort. This removes the need for the tiered sorting dropdown, as you can
		now sort by simply selecting one sort type after another, and the stability of the algorithm will
		keep equal list entries in the proper order.
	
	- Now uses SimpleSlash1 library to handle slash commands.
	
	- Added "/linkslist autofocus" command to toggle whether to autofocus the QuickSearch editbox
		whenever it becomes shown.
	
	- Added support for "GetLinkListDisplayName" and "GetSublinkListDisplayName" API functions.
		These functions will be called to find a name to display in the results list, as opposed to the
		plain "GetLinkName" and "GetSublinkName" functions, which are used to find names for various
		other purposes.
	
	- Rearranged the way the arrayIndexesBySource table is maintained, such that it is now created
		only once, when a given section is first registered. It is then updated as each extra search
		subsection is added. This has two benefits: first, the table does not need to be created each
		time a search is performed, and second, client addons can now build their functions to access
		data using the integer values from the table instead of the string keys, thus avoiding metatable
		lookups and increasing efficiency.
	
	- Now uses Blizzard's "IsModifiedClick" function to determine how to respond to modified clicks
		on link buttons.
	
	- Now shifts each link button's text to the left when the current section is not using sublinks.
	
	- Fixed a bug where fake link tooltips would not appear, on account of the code trying to call
		the function for fake sublink tooltips on that occasion, and vice versa.


1.1.0 (Feb 25, 2008):
	- Added a basic slash command system, through which you can configure options and toggle the
		results window.
	
	- Removed the "Basic Parameters" box from the Search frame, since the functionality granted by
		the checkbutton there was strongly limited and idiosyncratic, due to the way searches have to
		be performed.
	
	- Added developer support for "safe to link" checks and the ability to populate a fake tooltip in
		case it is not safe to link to the real one.
	
	- Added the ability to toggle the use of the ToggleButton (the small, mini-map style button), with
		the slash command "/linkslist togglebutton".
	
	- Fixed a bug where the results frame's title text would not update properly when new links were
		added to the currently selected section.
	
	- Now remembers between sessions the last section you were viewing, and restores that choice
		when the results window is opened.
	
	- The QuickSearch editbox is now autofocused when the results window is opened.
	
	- Fixed an issue where the ToggleButton's text would not properly turn yellow when there were
		new, unseen links in one of the sections.
	
	- Miscellaneous updates to code style.


1.0.1 (Nov 23, 2007):
	- Fixed an issue with subsection searching where an error would occur if a subsection's database
		had no information for an entry which the main section's database did.


1.0.0 (Nov 13, 2007):
	- Initial release.
