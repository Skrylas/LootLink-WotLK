This addon provides a GUI for viewing and searching various links databases. It is the successor
to the GUI portion of Saeris's LootLink (but it has no connection to the other successors of that addon,
LinkBot and QuickChatlink). The addon has support for five link types: abilities, items, quests, talents,
and tradeskills. If you wish to remove support for a link type (for instance, if you never use it and want
to conserve memory or improve initial login time), simply delete or rename the folder corresponding to
that link type in the Sections subdirectory. Some link types additionally have subsections which add
more searching and sorting options to their parent section; these too can be disabled by deleting or
renaming the appropriate folder within the Sections/<link type>/Subsections/ subdirectory.

To toggle the results window, use either the provided key binding (under the LinksList header in
the Key Bindings menu), or click the ToggleButton (a small, draggable minimap-style button that
can be found near the center of the screen on first load), or just type the slash command ("/ll" or
"/linkslist") without any subcommand. The results frame and search frame are both draggable. All
links displayed in the results frame will respond to modified clicks like standard chatlinks -- a Ctrl-click
will attempt to dress up in the link, a Shift-click will insert the link into the chat frame edit box, and
an unmodified click will toggle the static tooltip.

Configuration options are available via the "/linkslist" or "/ll" slash commands, and currently include
the ability to toggle whether the ToggleButton is used (subcommand "togglebutton"), the ability
to toggle whether to autofocus the QuickSearch editbox whenever it becomes shown (subcommand
"autofocus"), and the ability to toggle whether the results frame acts as a Blizzard UI panel (moves as
other panels open and close) (subcommand "panel"). Use the "help" subcommand ("/ll help") to view
this list of subcommands in-game.
