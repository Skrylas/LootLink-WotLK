--==-- QuestLinksDB2 Version History --==--

2.2.0 (Jan 16, 2009):
	Changed:
		- Database format is now a string table plus a lookup cache, rather than a massive hash
			table. This reduces memory usage to 27-59% of previous (starting at 27% and moving
			up as more links are cached by request). This also reduces loading time of the default
			database significantly. This change is completely transparent to client addons, though
			they can potentially be made more efficient by using the new parameters to IterateDB().


2.1.0 (Dec 10, 2008):
	New:
		- The CreateSorter() functions now accept two new parameters for more detailed sorter
			creation.


2.0.0 (Dec 5, 2008):
	New:
		- Rewritten for simplicity and efficiency.

	- Now uses LibStub as a load manager.


1.1.2 (Apr 23, 2008):

		active database instead of adding to it.
