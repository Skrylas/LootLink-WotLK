--==-- ItemBasicInfoDB3 Version History --==--

3.1.2 (Mar 8, 2009):
	Optimized:
		- Now uses an array for storing the static database, rather than a string table plus a lookup
			cache. This increases constant memory usage slightly unless you already have more than
			approximately 38,000 items in the database, but it reduces memory usage during searching
			and sorting, and dramatically lowers CPU usage.


3.1.1 (Feb 2, 2009):
	Optimized:
		- Now uses base 256 to store data, reducing memory usage by 10-15% and reducing CPU
			resources needed when searching the database.


3.1.0 (Jan 17, 2009):
	Changed:
		- Database format is now a string table plus a lookup cache, rather than a massive hash
			table. This reduces memory usage to 27-59% of previous (starting at 27% and moving
			up as more data is cached by request). This also reduces loading time of the default
			database significantly. This change is completely transparent to client addons, though
			they can potentially be made more efficient by using the new parameter to IterateDB().


3.0.0 (Dec 10, 2008):
	New:
		- Rewritten for simplicity and efficiency.


2.1.0 (May 13, 2008):
	- Added support for 2.4.2's new subtypes: in Trade Goods, "Materials", and in Miscellaneous,
		"Mount".
	
	- Fixed an error that occurred when attempting to memorize unknown types, subtypes, or
		equip locations.
	
	- Boosted default database size from 16626 to 18025.
	
	- Now uses LibStub as a load manager.


2.0.1 (Apr 23, 2008):
	- Cleaned up database loading code to handle multiple static databases more elegantly.


2.0.0 (Mar 1, 2008):
	- Is now an embeddable library instead of just a top-level library. There is still a top-level stub
		called Lib-ItemDB_BasicInfo2_SavedVariables which exists to reserve the saved errata for the
		library, but it is nothing more than a single .toc file.
	
	- Upped the number of entries in the default database from 9826 to 16626.
	
	- Now includes the AuctionScanner1 library for auction scanning, and will report how many new
		data were found after each scan. Check the AuctionScanner1 readme for more information.


1.0.0 (Nov 23, 2007):
	- Initial release.
