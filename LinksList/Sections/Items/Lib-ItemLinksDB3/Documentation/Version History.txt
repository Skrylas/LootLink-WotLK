--==-- ItemLinksDB3 Version History --==--

3.3.0 (Jan 12, 2009):
	Changed:
		- Database format is now a string table plus a lookup cache, rather than a massive hash
			table. This reduces memory usage to 27-59% of previous (starting at 27% and moving
			up as more links are cached by request). This also reduces loading time of the default
			database significantly. This change is completely transparent to client addons, though
			they can potentially be made more efficient by using the new parameters to IterateDB().
	
	Fixed:
		- Items with suffixes attached to their names no longer end up in the database due to
			blind chat link parsing.


3.2.1 (Dec 19, 2008):
	Changed:
		- Updated default database to ~29,000 items.
	
	Fixed:
		- Heirloom items are now stored with their proper rarity (7) rather than forcing them into
			the Artifact rarity (6). The ITEM_QUALITY_COLORS table is now modified to add an index
			7, containing the color information for client addons.


3.2.0 (Dec 15, 2008):
	New:
		- It is now possible to automatically import links from the saved variables file of Saeris's
			LootLink, Telo's LootLink, or the previous version of this addon, ItemDB_Links2. To do so,
			simply place the saved variables file ("LootLink.lua" or "Lib-ItemDB_Links2_SavedVariables.lua")
			from your <WoW>/WTF/Account/<account name>/SavedVariables directory into the
			Lib-ItemLinksDB3_SavedVariables folder, load the game once, and then delete the file.
	
	Changed:
		- Updated default database to ~26,000 items.


3.1.0 (Dec 10, 2008):
	New:
		- The CreateSorter() functions now accept two new parameters for more detailed sorter
			creation.
		- CombGetItemInfo() now accepts a parameter saying whether it should only add new
			items rather than updating everything as well.
	
	Changed:
		- Combing of the GetItemInfo() function now loops to at least the highest itemID currently
			in the database, rather than just the first 500-index gap. This ensures that the combing
			will find newer items.
		- The login scan of GetItemInfo() now searches only for new, not updated, items. This
			improves login time. Searches for updated items can be performed by client addons.
		- Removed slash commands.
	
	Optimized:
		- Initial loading of the base database now only checks the exclusion of items based on
			rarity if some rarity exclusions have been specified. This reduces loading time.


3.0.0 (Dec 5, 2008):
	New:
		- Rewritten for simplicity and efficiency.


2.1.1 (May 13, 2008):
	- Now uses LibStub as a load manager.


2.1.0 (Apr 27, 2008):
	- Added compatibility support for the LootLink_AddItem() function.


2.0.1 (Apr 23, 2008):
	- Cleaned up database loading code to handle multiple static databases more elegantly.


2.0.0 (Mar 1, 2008):
	- Is now an embeddable library instead of just a top-level library. There is still a top-level stub
		called ItemDB_Links2_SavedVariables which exists to reserve the saved errata for the library,
		but it is nothing more than a single .toc file.
	
	- Greatly improved database search speed when using a rarity-only search.
	
	- Now includes the AuctionScanner1 library for auction scanning, and will report how many new
		items were found after each scan. Check the AuctionScanner1 readme for more information.
	
	- Expanded default database size from 21191 to 21844.
	
	- Miscellaneous code style updates.


1.1.0 (Nov 21, 2007):
	- Now tries to add to its own database at login by searching through data from Telo's LootLink
		and Saeris's LootLink if either of those are loaded.
	
	- Now loads the initial number of entries in the static database from a constant number instead
		of iterating the database once to count the entries. This reduces load time slightly.


1.0.0 (Nov 13, 2007):
	- Initial release.
