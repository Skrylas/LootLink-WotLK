--==-- AbilityLinksDB2 Version History --==--

2.4.0 (Jan 12, 2009):
	Changed:
		- Database format is now a string table plus a lookup cache, rather than a massive hash
			table. This reduces memory usage to 27-59% of previous (starting at 27% and moving
			up as more links are cached by request). This also reduces loading time of the default
			database significantly. This change is completely transparent to client addons, though
			they can potentially be made more efficient by using the new parameters to IterateDB().


2.3.0 (Dec 24, 2008):
	Changed:
		- Since a significant number of ability links are not available via GetSpellLink(), and there
			is no warning as to when a given link may become unavailable, the default database
			has returned.


2.2.0 (Dec 19, 2008):
	Changed:
		- Now stores errata once again, for the occasional ability link that is not accessible via
			GetSpellLink().


2.1.0 (Dec 10, 2008):
	New:
		- The CreateSorter() function now accepts two new parameters for more detailed sorter
			creation.
	
	Changed:
		- Due to the nature of ability links and their consistent availability from the client via
			GetSpellLink(), the library now acts as a powerful wrapper for this function, dynamically
			creating a database from it, rather than maintaining its own list. This is actually
			transparent to clients, so no changes are needed.


2.0.0 (Dec 5, 2008):
	New:
		- Rewritten for simplicity and efficiency.


1.0.3 (May 13, 2008):
	- Now uses LibStub as a load manager.


1.0.2 (Apr 23, 2008):
	- Cleaned up database loading code to handle multiple static databases more elegantly.


1.0.1 (Apr 2, 2008):
	- Fixed a bug where links with brackets ([]) in their name weren't being parsed properly.


1.0.0 (Mar 25, 2008):
	- Initial release.
