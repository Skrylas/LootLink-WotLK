--==-- TradeskillLinksDB3 Version History --==--

3.3.1 (Mar 1, 2009):
	Fixed:
		- Unrecognized prefixes (such as "Runeforging: ") are now discarded immediately rather
			than being allowed to trigger the NAME_CHANGED event with oldData and newData
			both set to nil.


3.3.0 (Jan 17, 2009):
	Changed:
		- Database format is now a string table plus a lookup cache, rather than a massive hash
			table. This reduces memory usage to 27-59% of previous (starting at 27% and moving
			up as more links are cached by request). This also reduces loading time of the default
			database significantly. This change is completely transparent to client addons, though
			they can potentially be made more efficient by using the new parameters to IterateDB().


3.2.0 (Dec 19, 2008):
	Changed:
		- Now uses TRADE_SKILL_UPDATE to monitor for tradeskill links, rather than the other
			event, TRADE_SKILL_SHOW.


3.1.0 (Dec 10, 2008):
	New:
		- The CreateSorter() function now accepts two new parameters for more detailed sorter
			creation.
	
	Changed:
		- Removed slash commands.
	
	Fixed:
		- Removed some obsolete pseudo-tradeskills, like "Bite" and "Open Wound" and various
			"Poisons:", from the default database.


3.0.0 (Dec 5, 2008):
	New:
		- Rewritten for simplicity and efficiency.


2.0.3 (May 13, 2008):
	- Now uses LibStub as a load manager.


2.0.2 (Apr 23, 2008):
	- Cleaned up database loading code to handle multiple static databases more elegantly.


2.0.1 (Apr 2, 2008):
	- Fixed a bug where links with brackets ([]) in their name weren't being parsed properly.


2.0.0 (Mar 8, 2007):
	- Is now an embeddable library instead of just a top-level library. There is still a top-level stub
		called TradeskillDB_Links2_SavedVariables which exists to reserve the saved errata for the library,
		but it is nothing more than a single .toc file.
	
	- Expanded default database size from 1293 to 1312.
	
	- Miscellaneous code style updates.


1.0.1 (Nov 21, 2007):
	- Fixed TOC number. It was still 20100 instead of the proper 20300.
	
	- Now loads the initial number of entries in the static database from a constant number instead
		of iterating the database once to count the entries. This reduces load time slightly.


1.0.0 (Nov 13, 2007):
	- Initial release.
