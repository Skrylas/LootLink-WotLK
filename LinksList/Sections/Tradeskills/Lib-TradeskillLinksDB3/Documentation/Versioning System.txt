--==-- Versioning System (as of September 27th, 2008) --==--

This addon adheres to a #.#.# versioning format.

The first number (the 11 in 11.22.33) denotes the current major version. This number is
incremented when the addon's functionality or style of code changes so significantly
as to barely resemble previous versions. For library-type addons, which provide
functionality to client addons, this number is also a guarantee that every release
within this major version will be backwards compatible with previous releases that
are also within this major version. In these cases, this number is actually a suffix on the
library's name. This is done so newer major versions of libraries will not overwrite
older ones, since those may still be in use by other clients.

The second number (the 22 in 11.22.33) denotes the current minor version. This number
is incremented when functionality is added, modified, or removed.

The third number (the 33 in 11.22.33) denotes the current subminor version. This number is
incremented when a release's purpose is to fix bugs or errors, or to increase efficiency
in some way, or to make a minor cosmetic adjustment.
