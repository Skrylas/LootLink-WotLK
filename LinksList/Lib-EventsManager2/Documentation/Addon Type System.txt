--==-- Addon Type System (as of November 10th, 2008) --==--

This addon uses a system in which there are three distinct types of addons.

Interface: These addons actually provide functionality to the user. They may be entirely self-
contained, or they may make use of library-type and plugin-type addons. Interface-type addons
always appear with this directory path:
	<game directory>/Interface/AddOns/<interface name>/

Library: These addons exist simply to provide functionality to other addons of any type, and
as their type name suggests, they may be shared between multiple other addons as a single,
efficient source of the aforementioned functionality. For convenience, all library-type addons
are prefixed with "Lib" to identify them from the other types of addons. Libraries may appear
either included with the addons that use them (often in a subdirectory called "libs" or "Libraries")
or as a normal addon, with directory paths like these:
	<game directory>/Interface/AddOns/<library name>/
	<game directory>/Interface/AddOns/<interface or plugin using the library>/libs/<library name>/
	<game directory>/Interface/AddOns/<interface or plugin using the library>/<library name>/
If they are included, the user does not need to worry about versions (since each addon includes
the version it needs, and libraries are backwards compatible); if they are installed as normal
addons, the user is responsible for ensuring that the installed version of the library is up to date.
Library addons may have their major version suffixed to their name, such as "Library3" for a
library of version 3.x.x, in cases where backwards compatibility cannot be maintained across
major versions. This allows the older version of the library to remain installed and providing
functionality even when a newer version is also present.

Plugin: These addons are generally optional, and "plug in" to interface-type addons to provide
additional functionality. Most interface-type addons which use plugins will not actually provide
any significant functionality on their own. Generally, plugins will include the name of their parent
interface addon in their own name to help identify them. Plugin-type addons may appear with
these directory paths like these:
	<game directory>/Interface/AddOns/<plugin name>/
	<game directory>/Interface/AddOns/<parent interface name>/Plugins/<plugin name>/
	<game directory>/Interface/AddOns/<parent interface name>/<plugin name>/

An addon's type and any libraries it uses are listed at the top of its functionality description
text file.
